# Space-X-Project

Project background and context:

The commercial space age is here, companies are making space travel affordable for everyone. There are major companies in segment, like Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, and Space X. The current leader in this race seems to be the last one, and the reason behind that is the reusability of their first stage. Which reduces the cost of launch from aÂ  minimum of 165 million to around 62 million per launch.
The objective of this Project is to evaluate the viability of a new company to compete with Space X. So, we need to find the best way to estimate the total cost for launches, by predicting successful landings of the first stage of rockets and where is the best place to make launches.

So, the questions are:

What factors determine if the rocket will land successfully?

What is the interaction amongst various features that determine the rate of a successful landing?

Conditions which will aid SpaceX have to achieve the best results.
